scripts directory
===============
This directory contains files used for getting people up and going on the Badger framework.  This 
includes scripts to set up your local machine (or a VM), and scripts to create a test-runner machine 
on aws.  From that test-runner machine, you can develop or run new tests that use Badger.

This directory also includes scripts and files to set up a MongoDB database, as part of the reporting 
arm of the Badger framework.
